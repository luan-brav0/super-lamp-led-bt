# Super Lamp
A Super Mario Brothers' themed smart lamp using a ESP32

## To do
- [X] find old final wifi version file (tryed teaching designers to use github close to a dead line, here we are now)
- [ ] wifi profisioning instead of hardcoding
    - [ ] esp touch app wifimanager.h
- [X] have the pipe sfx when turning off
    - [ ] make sure pipe off sound is actually in tune
- [ ] get over my first fail trying to code a react native expo app to connect with this and actually create a front end besides that println html we had come up to
